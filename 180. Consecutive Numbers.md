Solution given by me:

select distinct(num) as ConsecutiveNums 
from
(
select id, lead(id) over(order by id) as id_check,lead(id,2) over(order by id) as id_check_2, num, lead(num) over(order by id) as lead_1, lead(num,2) over(order by id) as lead_2  from logs
)X
where num=lead_1 and num=lead_2 and id_check-id=1 and id_check_2-id_check=1

****************************************

Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column.
 

Find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
